## Project description
- electro store is an online smartphone store that uses angular to compartmentalize the application to components that share data between themselves and   utilizes angular routing to make a single page application i.e eliminating the need for reloading to go to other page views.

- the application has a main product list view, a product detail view, a cart view, and a confirmation view upon a successful order.

- the main product list view has product components showing an image of the product i.e smartphone and it's name, upon hovering on a smartphone card the card will elevate and expand showing brief specs about the smartphone, users have the option to add a product to cart directly from list view.

- the product detail view has an image of the smartphone, a description, price, and specs, the product detail view offers the option to change the quantity of the smartphone(s) to be added to cart.

- the cart view shows smartphones in the cart with the ability to remove an item, users can edit the quantity of an item from the cart, the cart view has a validated forum to be filled with the necessary data to making an order, upon a successful order users will be redirected to an order success page with a thanking message as well as details about shipping time.
